# Folding Analysis

This is a library for analyzing a protein folding simulation. It is still in development. It uses the library for reading in a dcd file [here](https://github.com/FHedin/read_dcd/).

## Installation

If, for some bizarre reason, you'd like to use your code, set up your project directory as follows. 

lib: all read_dcd files except main

src: as is

output: blank

resources: dcd, pdb, psf (unused currently) files
